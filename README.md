## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    
    Discord - 
        Ability to have statuses and descriptions on one's profile
        Create large servers and form communities
        Upload Discord bots that can moderate servers or be silly
        
    YouTube -
        Add videos to different playlists and share them with a simple link
        Like and dislike videos
        Subscribe to your favorite content creators to show support
    
    Spotify -
        Specialized music playlists made based on the viewers' favorite songs
        Section of recommended songs on the bottom of playlists
        Ability to listen with your friends
        Ability to transition each song into one another smoothly (It works because the music fades together)
        
        (app idea)
        ArtUnite is an app where users are able to share their artworks with people all over the world; whether that be stories, paintings, or music
        pieces, there is a multitude of ways to design and make the profile your own. Inspired by DeviantArt and GitHub, users can store their work
        privately or share it with others. Other features include duetting someone (in a song, collaborating on an art piece, etc.), using basic CSS  
        and HTML to design your own user pages, linking your socials as you create your personalized art portfolio, and participating in art 
        competitions hosted by our users and moderators!


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Difficulty with navigating Xcode (found resources on Youtube to help)
- Missing file from original folder, but was able to get the repo's URL and implemented that
